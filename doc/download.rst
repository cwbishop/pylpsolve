Download
========================================

A source tarball is available from
http://github.com/downloads/hoytak/pylpsolve/pylpsolve-v1.0.tar.gz.
Installing this package on linux this requires the lpsolve5.5 and
colamd development libraries to be installed.  Installation can then
be done with::

  python setup.py install 

The test suite may then be run using::

  python tests/tests.py

Cython_ is not required to install this, as the source tarball
includes the generated C code.  To regenerate the code with a local
cython_ installation, one can instead run::

  python setup.py install --cython

*If someone who is more familar with compiling lpsolve on multiple
platforms would assist me in getting together a robust source package
and setup script that "just works" on Windows, OS X, and linux, I'd be
happy to put it in the python cheese shop.  This would allow
installation through the easy_install utilities.  Until that happens,
however, it will just be hosted on my website.*

Developers
----------------------------------------

For developers, a `git`_ source repository is available on `github`_.
You can clone that repository with the following command::

    git clone git://github.com/hoytak/pylpsolve.git

Bug reports are very welcome and can be submitted at
http://github.com/hoytak/pylpsolve/issues.  Patches can be emailed to
me as a diff file or submitted through git-hub.

The github development repository does not include the C source code
generated by cython_, making cython_ a dependency for development.
