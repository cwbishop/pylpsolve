Download
========================================

A source tarball is available from
http://www.stat.washington.edu/code/tarballs/pylpsolve-current.tar.bz2.
On linux, this requires the lpsolve5.5 and colamd development
libraries to be installed.  Installation can then be done with::

  python setup.py install 

Cython_ is not required to install this, as the source tarball
includes the generated C code.  To regenerate the code with a local
cython_ installation, one can instead run::

  python setup.py install --cython

If someone who is familar with getting a robust source package and
setup script together that "just works" on windows, OS X, and linux,
I'd be happy to put it in the python cheese shop to make this process
easier.  

Developers
----------------------------------------

For developers, a `git`_ source repository is available on `github`_.
You can clone that repository with the following command::

    git clone git://github.com/hoytak/pylpsolve.git

Bug reports are very welcome and can be submitted at
http://github.com/hoytak/pylpsolve/issues.  Patches can be emailed to
me as a diff file or submitted through the git-hub

The github development repository does not include the C source code
generated by cython_, making cython_ a dependency.
